Q1) What is Entity?
 
👉 @Entity is an annotation type; Product is a concrete java class.
         (Annotations are internally interfaces in Java.). 

               (OR) 

👉 @Entity marks a Java class as a JPA entity.
    The Product class represents a database table, and its instance variables represent the
    columns of that table.
    Each object of the Product class represents one row in the table.

👉 Note : By default, the entity class name is used as the table name unless overridden using @Table

Q2) How do we rename a database table in a Java Entity class?
      👉 We use the @Table annotation.

Q3) What is ORM? How do we implement in spring boot?
     👉 ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a technique that maps Java classes to database tables and
        class variables to table columns.
        In Spring Boot, ORM is implemented using JPA, with Hibernate as the underlying ORM framework.
